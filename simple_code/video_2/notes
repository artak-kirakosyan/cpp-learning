setlocale - set local formats(in linux russian supported even without setlocale)

code is executed line by line
// - one line comment

/* */ - multiline comment


#include - tell the pre-processor to include library
it substitutes the code in the library in the place of #include

namespaces - a scope where functions and operators work
using namespace std - set default namespace to std

if we skip using namespace std, we would need to do std::cout and std::endl
