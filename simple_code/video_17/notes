For: details

variables declared in the initialization part of the for loop are local and
not visible for the outside scope

but we can manage variables from outside scope of the for in the initialization step.
Example:

int i = 0;
for (i = 4; i > 0; i--)


non of the 3 parts in the for loop are mandatory:
for(i = 0; i < 10; i++)
{
    some code
}

is the same as 
for(i=0; i < 10;)
{
    some code
    i++;
}
be careful with positioning the i++ in the block.
If we put it before the "some code", the result might be different.


Also note that we can put combined statements in each of these parts:
for example:

for (int i = 1, b =3; i < 10 && b > 1; i++)
{
}
