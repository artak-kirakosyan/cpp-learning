GOTO

NOTE: do not use goto, or at least avoid using it

We can tell the computer to go to a specific identifier and continue 
from there

FOr that purpose, we have to create these identifiers and use
goto identifier; to go there

example:

cout << "A" << endl;

goto link;

cout << "B" << endl;

link:
cout << "C" << endl;

When executed, this will print out A and C only, as when we encounter the goto
command, it finds the link identifier and continues execution from there(line 19)
