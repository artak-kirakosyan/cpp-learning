break

sometimes we want to interrupt a loop earlier than specified.
For that we use the keyword "break".
for(int i = 0; i < 10; i++)
{
    if (i == 5)
    {
        break;
    }
    cout << i << endl;
}

Output:
0
1
2
3
4
and that's it: as the break will break the loop

break can be use in for, while and do while loops
