Usually we need to compare some variables to see if they are equal, greater or less. To do so, we have logic operators:

int a = 4;
int b = 5;

cout << (a < b) << endl;
This will print 1 as the condition is true.

Logic conditions return boolean type and 0 for false, and 1 for true.
Logic operators are as follows:

< less than
> greater than
>= grater than or equal
<= less than or equal
== equality
!= no equality


Be careful: equality is checked by 2 equal signs, as 1 equal sign is the assignment operator.

Logical operators to combine logic statements

&& - and
|| - or
! - not


!true is false
true && false - false
true || false - true

&& and || can be used to combine conditions:

int a = 1;
int b = 3;

cout << ((a <= 2) && (b > 3)) << endl;

first check if a <= 2, if its true, evaluate the second condition as well then combine the result: true && false -> false.

The operators && and || also have priorities. We can enforce our desired order
by using () brackets.
