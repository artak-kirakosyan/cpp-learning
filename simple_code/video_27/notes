How to print out array and how to interact with them properly

const int size = 10;

int arr[size];

for (int i = 0; i < size; i++)
{
    cout << arr[i];
}

This is a usual way to iterate over an array.
It is usually a good practice to keep the size in a constant and use that
to refer to the size of the array. it is easier and less error prone.
Remember that indexes are from 0 to size-1, that's why we used for loop with 
that parameters

We can use this approach to initialize, modify, print and play around with our
array
