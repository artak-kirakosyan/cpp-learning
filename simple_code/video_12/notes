If else

if (logical condition)
{
    the code that executes in case of true logical condition.
}
else if (another condition)
{
    the code that will be executed if the first condition is false, and second is true
}
else
{   
    the code that executes if non of the above blocks get executed
}

We can combine as many "else if" statements as we want.
Only one of the if, else if and else statements will be executed.
