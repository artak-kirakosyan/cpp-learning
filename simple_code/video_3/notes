To print out special characters such as double quotes in a string, or back-slash.

To do so, we use a back-slash. It escapes the next symbol

FOr example to print He\\o, you have to escape the back-slashes

cout << "He\\\\o";
The first 2 backslashes will print out 1 backslash, the last 2 another one.

If you need double quotes in a string, again escape them

cout << "\"Hello\""; will print out Hello"

Some special characters:
\n - new line
\t - tab
\b - delete last printed symbol


Symbols to escape:
1. "
2. \
These are the ones I know so far.
If you know any new ones, let me know
