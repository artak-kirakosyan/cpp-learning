How to insert data into program

There is a command called cin to insert data into program.
Example:
we want to square some number, but that number should be given by the user.
So we ask for a number from the user with cin, and then square and print it out.


To confirm the input you have to hit Enter.
One weird thing is that if you input several values separated by a space, here is what it does:

Lets say your program is asking for 2 numbers:
int v1, v2;

cout << "enter first: ";
cin >> v1;
cout << "enter second: ";
cin >> v2;

When we excute, it will promtpt "enter first: "
Now we type "1 2" and then hit enter.
Instead of asking a second input, the program just prints out the "enter second: "
and exits.

Probably the reason is that the cin is splitting the input arguments and saving in a queue.
And once the second cin is asking for an input, the 2 in the queue is getting
into the variable straight away.

Another weird behavior is when inserting invalid inputs, the program ignores all
future cin commands and just executes the rest of the code
example:

cout << "enter numbers:";
cin >> v1;
cin >> v2;

cout << "v1=" << v1 << endl;
cout << "v2=" << v2 << endl;

when executed, if I insert a char and hit enter, instead of being asked for a second
input, the program is executed to the end and exits.
