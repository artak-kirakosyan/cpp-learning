Debugging:

No matter what you write, where you write and how you write, you have to know 
how to use debuggers.

2 types of errors: compile time and runtime

1. compile time: compiler finds issues and refuses to continue and create the executable
2. runtime error: when the errors were not visible during compilation and show up only
while execution.

Depending on what OS and environment you work, there are different debuggers.

In Visual Studio, there is a built-in debugger.

In Linux/UNIX if you work with plain terminal, you can use GDB.

What debugger does is that it stops the execution of the program on specific
breakpoints that you set.

Debugger helps to identify what issues are present in the code, and helps easier
detect them.

Debuggers allow to execute the code line by line and see the values of variables
and pointers in real time.
