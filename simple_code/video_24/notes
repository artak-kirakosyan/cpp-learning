Enclosed loops

Sometimes we might want to iterate over something, while we are
iterating over something else

to do this, we use enclosed loops.

for (int i = 1; i <= 3; i++)
{
    cout << "First loop: " << i << endl;
    for (int j = 0; j < 3; j++)
    {
        cout << "Second loop: " << j << endl;
    }
}

This will print out:
First loop: 1
Second loop 0
Second loop 1
Second loop 2

First loop: 2
Second loop 0
Second loop 1
Second loop 2

First loop: 3
Second loop 0
Second loop 1
Second loop 2

As we see , for each iteration of the first loop, we execute the second loop
completely

This is a useful architecture for lots of reasons, but also we have to be careful
as this process can take a loooong time to execute.
if the first loop has 1000 iterations, and second one has also 1000 iterations,
the whole program will have to do 1.000.000 iterations. This is very slow.
