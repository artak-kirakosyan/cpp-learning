Loops:

Sometimes we want to repeat certain instruction multiple time, maybe fixed number
of times, or maybe until some condition is met.

For that purpose there is the concept of the loop

while (condition)
{
    block that gets executed
}

1. check the condition
2. execute the block
3. go to 1

Be careful of infinite loops such as:

while (true)
{
    cout << 'a' << endl;
}
This code will execute forever until killed(CTRL+C)
