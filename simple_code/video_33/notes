Functions

Separate a reusable part of a code which may accept some arguments, does some
operations and may return some results.

an example is the rand, srand, time.

good example of using function is when you want to print out an array.
instead of rewriting that part of the code again and again, we can define a function
and call it every time we want.

function definition:

return_type name_of_function (arg_type arg_name, arg_type arg_name_2,...)
{
    function body;
}

if you dont want to return anything, you specify void as the return type

same for arguments. if no arguments, specify void in arguments field


It is important to define the function before calling it.

C++ allows to define a prototype of a function, and then implement it.

With that way you tell the compiler: hey this is the function, I am going to 
define it later, just dont panik okay?
And the compiler will shut up for a moment(untill it finds out you forgot to 
implement your function)

exaple:

int sum_num(int a, int b)
{
    return a + b;
}
