Arrays

Array - container, that allows to store elements of one specific type
each element has an index and an array has a name

In memory, elements of the array are stored right next to each other.

when creating an array, we specify the size, and the computer allocates
proper amount of memory cells to store necessary info

Indexing in c++ starts from 0: third element is at array[2]

How to declare an array:

d_type name[size];

In this case the array will not be initialized.
To initialize the array during declaration we can do the following:

int name[4] = {1, 2, 3, 4};

we could also do name[1] = 1; name[2] = 2; and so on to initialize after
declaration.

If we access indexes out of the size of the array, we can encounter a segmentation
fault(good) or get a random garbage value(bad);
Getting segmentation fault is good because we know what is wrong and can fix it.
If we get a random garbage value, we might know know that something is wrong
and at some point that issue will slap you in the face.

Same when we try to write to the blocks out of the size of the array.
