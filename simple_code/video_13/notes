Switch 

Instead of combining 12 if else statements there is a functionality of
the switch case.
Here is how it works
switch(expression)
{
    case value_1:
        do something;
        break;
    case value_2:
        do_something;
        break;
    ...
    ...
    ...
    default:
        do something;
        break;
}

The computer evaluates the expression and starts checking on equality with 
values specified in cases. Once it is equal, it executes the code under that case, 
and then executes all below cases without checking on equality.
To make switch work as a cascade of if statements, we use break after each case.
That means we will execute one block of case, and then exit the switch block
(that is what break means).

One thing to note is that default case is optional, we can skip it.

Default is for the case, when non of the cases were executed, then default is being executed
