Increment and decrement

To increase or decrease the value of a variable, we can use multiple approaches:
a = a + 1;
a += 1
a++;
++a;

same for decrement:
a = a - 1;
a -= 1;
a--;
--a;

What is special abut this ++ or --
There are 2 types as we see: prefixed and postfixed:

a++ - postfix
++a -- prefix

if we just do the increment, no difference
but if we do this:
cout << a++ << endl;
cout << ++a << endl;

In the first case, the old value of the a would be printed, and then the value of the a would be incremented.

But if we do the second way(prefixed)
then we will increment the value, then print out.

The same applies to decrement.

In case of a mixed operations such as ++a*a++, there is a operator priority, which
allows the compiler to decide which operation to apply first.
