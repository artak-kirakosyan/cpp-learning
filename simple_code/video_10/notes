Shortened arithmetic operators;

in case of increment or decrement we have a short version of the + and - operators.
What about changing the value by an amount different from 1 or -1.

Here is it:

a += 10;
b -= 23;
c /= 2;
d *= 3;
c %= 10;

This is exactly the same as a = a + 10 and so on

It is recommended to use shortened versions as they are easier to read.
