Keyword "const"

Const is a variation of a variable, which should have the same value throughout 
the whole program
To declare a constant variable,
you add a keyword const in the beggining of the variable declaration


const int YEAR = 2020
const float PI = 3.1415

Constant variable should have all capitalized names, its just a convention.

You have to give the value of the constant at the declaration stage.
