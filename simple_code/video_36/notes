Function prototypes

We have to define the functions before using them

so if you want to define a helper function and use it in the main, we have to 
put it above the main.
This is because the compiler is reading the code from top to bottom.


but if you add several functions, the main will be lost in the end of the file
and wont be easy to read.

To workaround this is to define a prototype of a function above main, then 
write its implementation below


the prototype is:
return_type func_name(argument_type arg_name, ...);

Dont forget the semicolon
