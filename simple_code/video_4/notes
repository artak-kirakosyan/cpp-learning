The data we plan to use in a program are being stored in RAM.

In C++ there are different types of "containers" to store data for proper
storage and future usage(its hard to store water in a paper box :)

data types:
1. numerical
2. symbolic
3. logical

float 4 bytes - real numbers
double 8 bytes - real numbers

while numbers:
int 4 bytes 
short 4 bytes
long 4 bytes

symbolic:
char 1 byte

logical:
bool 1 byte: true or false
