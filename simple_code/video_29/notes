rand srand

Generating random numbers
Why? - Why not?
It is useful sometimes

to get random numbers, we use rand function;

int a = rand();

if we run this program again and again, we will get the same numbers.

Not very random right?

It is because these numbers are not random, and their starting point is the same
every time.
To solve this is to use srand. this function sets the seed of the random numbers.

srand(10);
int a = rand();

the problem is still there.
because every time the seed is 10, which means we still get same numbers every time

to solve this we import ctime module,
and do the following:
srand(time(NULL));
int a = rand();

time returns the number of milliseconds passed from 1970 Jan 1.
This is the start of the timing in all modern computers

with this way, during every run, the seed will be different.


How about the range of the generated numbers

int a = rand() % 10;
will generate numbers from 0 to 9.

to make it from for example 6 to 9
we do this

int a = rand() % 4 + 6

%4 will bring the range from 0 to 3,, and +6 will bring it to 6 to 9.


Now we can use this approach to fill in an array with random values
