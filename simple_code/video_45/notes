Dynamic memory(heap)

to study pointers and references, we need to understad static and dynamic
memory

When we execute our program, the computer knows how much memory the
arrays and variables need. So it allocates some amount of memory to store
all these things.

If we want to, we can ask for additional memory as we might not know in advance
what amount of memory we will be needing.

example: we read information from DB, we dont know how much info there is.

In c++, if we ask the computer to give us a bit more dynamic memory in RAM,
we have to clean that memory after using it as c++ does NOT clean after you.
If your program works for a while and does not clean, but keeps asking for more
and more memory, it will eventually crash as you will run out of memory.

that's why c++ is considered a low level programming language compared to 
for example c# or java, it allows more control and more opportunites in work 
with memory and surrounding environment.(it doesnt mean c++ is better than java
or c# as doing stuff in c++ is harder)
