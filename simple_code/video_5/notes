variable: its a chunk of memory in RAM which can store some data and has
a name associated with it to refer to that memory

to declare a variable we have to tell the compiler the type of the variable 
and the name as such:
type name;

If we want to assign an initial value to the variable at the declaration
we can do so like this:
type name = initial_value;

If we dont assign an initial value, there might be some garbage value stored in that chunk of memory. It might 

If we need several variables, we can do so:
int a, b, c;
this will declare 3 variables.

we can also initialize several variables in one line:
int a = 1, b = 2, c = 3;

It is usually a good practice to initialize variables. The behavior of the uninitialized variables depends on the compiler you use.


Rules in naming variables:
1. should start with an _ or alphabetic symbol. Can contain alphanumeric and _
