Passing arguments to the function by pointer.

As we remember, if we pass an integer to a function, which increments the value
of that integer, when we come back to main, the value of the integer was not 
affected(varible scopes)

to change the value, we were forced to return the new value from the function
and assign the returned value to our integer.

Now, we can do it easier using pointers.
as we remember, when we pass an array to a function, modify the array in the
function and then print out the array in main, we see that it changed its value
that is because array's name is a pointer, and arrays are being passed by pointer
and when we modify the value of elements in the function, we write the new 
values in the same address where the array is stored.
that is why the changes are preserved
