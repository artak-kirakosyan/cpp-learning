Arithmetic operators

Operator is a character, a symbol that represents some predefined functionality.
Example: summation +
         subtraction -
         division /
         multiplication *
         modulus %
         greater >
         less  <
         grater or equal >=
         less or equal <=
         and so on

Operators: unary, binary and ternary

There is only 1 ternary operator, will discuss it later

Unary - to operate, we need just one operand
Binary - 2 operands to function
Ternary - 3 operands


Unary negate operator:
int a = 4;
a = -a;

Binary operators:
int c;
int a = 1;
int b = 2;
c = a + b;
c = a - b;
c = a * b;
c = b / a;

Priority of operators:
c = a + b*d;
b*d will be done first, then added to a;
same as in mathematics

c = (a + b) * d;
first brackets and then multiplication
