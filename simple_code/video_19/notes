Continue

If we want to skip some part of the block in the loop, we use continue


Example:

we want to print out all numbers from 1 to 10, except 5.

for(int i = 1, i <= 10; i++)
{
    if (i == 5)
    {
        continue;
    }
    cout << i << endl;
}

this will check if i is equal to 5, then skip the rest of the block and hence,
will not print out 5.
The rest of the numbers will be printed

Continue can be used in any loop and works the same
