sizeof

This function return the number of bytes that are reserved for that variable, 
type or anything.

This is useful if we dont know the size of the array, we can do the following

int arr[]{4,5,6};

we dont know the size of this array;

we can use sizeof

const int SIZE = sizeof(arr) / sizeoff(int);

for (int i = 0; i < SIZE; i++)
{

}
We should be aware of what type of data the array stores

This approach is not very good one as if we change the type of the array from 
int to double for example, the code will break.

Instead we can use it like this:

const int SIZE = sizeof(arr) / sizeoff(arr[0]);

This way is better as we use the first element of the array to get the size
of an element.
