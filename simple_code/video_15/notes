do while

While loop can skip execution straigh away. If the condition is false at the very
beginning, then the block inside the while wont get executed
Sometimes we might want the block to be executed at least once.
Use do while


do
{
    block of code
} while (condition);

1. execute the block
2. check the condition
3. go to step 1.

as we see, the block will be executed at least once.
