Stack.

What is stack?

Stack is a segment in the memory.

Stack is last input, first output(LIFO) structure.
The best stack example: you wash the plates and put them one on top of the other.
When you need a plate, which one you take first? exactly: the one that was put
there the last.

The same is related to C++.
When you call a function which calls another function and so on, 
each function is placed in a stack, and when its executes is done, it is removed
from the stack.

If you place too many function calls in the stack, and you run out of stack
memory, you will have stackoverflow error
