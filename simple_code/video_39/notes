Inline

inline is a kind of recommendation to the compiler.

int Sum(int a, int b)
{
    return a + b;
}

If we use this function, when the execution line reaches the function call,
the executor is looking to find where the function is stored, it passes arguments
and returns the result.

That takes some time.

But we we put hte keyword inline in front of the function prototype,
the compile will put the procedure happening inside the function right in the
execution flow.
That means the instructions wont include calling a separate function.

as stated above, this is a recommendation rather than a command to the compiler
that means the compiler will decide for itself to do or not to do.
